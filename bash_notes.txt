Pitfalls:
* Need spaces between commands/operators
* don't forget the if, then, fi

#!/bin/bash - start of script
read var1 - read from stdin
echo $var1 - output contents of var1

For loop syntax: 
for num in {1..50}
do
  echo $num
done

Math:
read x
read y
echo $(($x+$y))

If statement synxtax:
if [ $x -gt $y ]
then
    echo X is greater than Y
elif [ $x -eq $y ]
then    
    echo X is equal to Y
else
    echo X is less than Y
fi
