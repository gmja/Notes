Continuous delivery and deployment pipeline
Build -> Deploy -> Test -> Release

Jobs for each stage that are chained

1. Developers make changes and commit to version control
2. Jenkins build job polls for changes (or runs on an interval) and creates output file
3. deployment jobs run to deploy to test environment
4. test jobs run against test environment
5. deployment to production
